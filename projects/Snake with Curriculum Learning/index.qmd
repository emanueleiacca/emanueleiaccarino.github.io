This project implements a **reinforcement learning agent** for the classic Snake game using **Stable Baselines3**.  
A **curriculum learning strategy** is applied: the agent is trained on smaller, simpler boards before progressing to larger and more complex environments.  

**Methods**  
- Custom Snake environments in `snakeenv.py` and `snakeenv2.py`  
- RL training with **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**  
- Curriculum schedule: gradually increasing board size and difficulty  
- Logging and monitoring with Stable Baselines3 tools  

**Key results**  
- Agent successfully learned to play Snake across multiple board sizes  
- Achieved a maximum score of **18 apples eaten** in evaluation runs  
- Curriculum learning improved convergence speed and stability compared to direct training on large boards
