This project introduces **SQLParserDataPipeline**, a Python package for parsing and interpreting **complex SQL queries**.  
It was designed with **BigQuery** in mind but is flexible enough to adapt to other SQL dialects thanks to a parsing strategy focused on the **inner query structure** rather than specific SQL functions.  

**Core capabilities**  
- **Select Clause Parsing**: handles nested queries, functions, and placeholders beyond the scope of standard parsers  
- **From Clause Analysis**: extracts tables and aliases in medium-complexity queries  
- **Unnest Transformations**: identifies join types, aliases, and unique values, crucial for data pipeline design  

**Key strengths**  
- Outperforms standard SQL parsers on queries with nested SELECTs and functions  
- Enables clearer lineage extraction and debugging for ETL workflows  
- Provides transparent parsing results, supporting modular pipeline development
