This project develops a **customer churn prediction model** for the banking sector, aiming to identify the top 10,000 clients most likely to close their accounts.  

**Methods**  
- **Preprocessing**: data cleaning, categorical encoding  
- **Sampling**: cost-sensitive techniques to address class imbalance  
- **Boosting algorithms**: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, with ensemble weighting  
- **Hyperparameter optimization**: automated tuning with **Optuna**  
- **Interpretability**: **SHAP values** for global and local feature importance  

**Key results**  
- Ensemble boosting models achieved the best performance using a custom **Rank Probabilities metric**, prioritizing recall of churners  
- Synthetic data improved testing robustness on unseen distributions  
- SHAP analysis revealed key socio-demographic and account features driving churn risk
