<!-- # Motivation -->

Access to healthcare is a fundamental right, yet many individuals still abandon or forgo necessary medical care due to financial, social, or systemic barriers. Understanding *who* is at risk and *why* is crucial to design effective policies.  
This project leverages the **2019 European Health Interview Survey (EHIS)** to investigate medical care abandonment in Italy, combining data-driven insights with machine learning models.  

<!-- # What's in the project? -->

This work implements advanced methods for prediction, interpretability, and robustness:

- **Data preprocessing**: cleaning, handling missing values, thematic grouping, and skip-logic adjustments.  
- **Exploratory data analysis**: socio-demographic patterns across age, gender, geography, and social factors.  
- **Modeling**: multinomial logistic regression and XGBoost classifiers, with population weighting.  
- **Feature selection**: LASSO regression and gain-based importance, stability tested via bootstrap resampling.  
- **Uncertainty quantification**: conformal prediction framework for reliable, uncertainty-aware classifications.  
- **Interpretability**: SHAP analysis for both global and local feature importance.  

<!-- # Results -->

- **Performance**: XGBoost outperforms logistic regression, achieving higher precision and F1-score for healthcare avoiders, with fewer false positives.  
- **Key predictors**: renunciation indicators (dental care, medication, mental health) emerge as the strongest signals.  
- **Uncertainty**: conformal prediction provides valid coverage with smaller prediction sets for XGBoost.  
- **Insights**: results highlight regional disparities and vulnerable population groups, offering concrete input for policymakers.
