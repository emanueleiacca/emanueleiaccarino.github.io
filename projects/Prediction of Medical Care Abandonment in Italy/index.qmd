This project investigates **medical care abandonment in Italy** using the **2019 European Health Interview Survey (EHIS)**.  
The analysis combines **machine learning models** (multinomial logistic regression, XGBoost) with advanced techniques for **feature selection, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability**.  

Key methods include:  
- **LASSO regression** and **gain-based importance** for feature selection  
- **Bootstrap stability analysis**  
- **Conformal prediction** for uncertainty-aware classification  
- **SHAP analysis** for model interpretability  

Results show that **XGBoost outperforms logistic regression**, renunciation indicators (dental care, medication, mental health) are the strongest predictors, and conformal prediction provides reliable coverage. These findings highlight **regional disparities and vulnerable population groups**, offering actionable insights for policymakers.
