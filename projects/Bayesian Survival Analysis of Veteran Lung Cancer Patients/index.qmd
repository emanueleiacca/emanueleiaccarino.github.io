This project applies **Bayesian survival analysis** to the Veteran’s Administration Lung Cancer dataset, focusing on **parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models**.  

The work compares **exponential** and **Weibull AFT models** using **MCMC estimation in JAGS**, with model fit assessed via the **Deviance Information Criterion (DIC)**.  
Posterior predictive checks and parameter recovery experiments are used to evaluate calibration and identifiability, while results are contrasted with **frequentist survival models** such as Cox PH and parametric AFT.  

Key findings include the superior fit of the Weibull model, significant effects of cell type on survival, and good calibration under posterior predictive validation.
