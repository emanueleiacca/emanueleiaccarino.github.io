This project examines the **impact of recreational marijuana legalization** on drug-related mortality, with a focus on opioids and cocaine.  
The analysis applies **causal inference methods** including **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**, **Instrumental Variables (IV, 2SLS & 2SRI)**, and **Event Studies**, using state-level panel data from the CDC.  

**Methods**  
- Panel dataset: Massachusetts (treatment) vs. New Hampshire (control)  
- Data cleaning and imputation via Kalman filtering  
- DiD and Event Study with monthly leads/lags  
- IV estimation to address potential endogeneity  
- Binary Logit/Probit robustness checks  

**Key results**  
- üìâ Significant decline in **cocaine deaths** after legalization (DiD & Event Study)  
- ‚öñÔ∏è No statistically significant effect on **opioid mortality**  
- ‚úÖ Placebo and robustness checks confirm validity of cocaine result  
- üåç Findings highlight implications for European countries facing emerging overdose risks
