    "text": "Hi there, I’m Emanuele Iaccarino.\nNumbers have always been my way of making sense of the world — turning ideas into structures, spotting patterns in the noise, and breaking problems into steps I could work through. For a long time I saw this as nothing more than my own way of thinking. Only later did I realize that this mindset is exactly what lies at the heart of data science, and that following this path wasn’t really a choice but the most natural direction forward.\nThat realization shaped my journey. What started as curiosity grew into building models, working with messy data, and uncovering the stories hidden inside. It became not just something I enjoyed, but something I wanted to dedicate myself to fully. Data science didn’t arrive in my life as a plan — it arrived as the recognition of what I had been doing all along.\nEven this website reflects that story. I built it with Quarto, the modern framework born from RStudio, where I first learned to bring statistics, code, and storytelling together. Using the same ecosystem here feels natural — a continuation of the roots that shaped me, now powering the place where I share what I’m building today."

    "text": "For me, data science is not just about writing code or training models — it’s about the way you approach problems. What makes me different is not a single skill, but a combination of habits and attitudes that shape the way I work.\n\nCuriosity. I don’t stop at results, I always want to know why something behaves the way it does. That’s what keeps me digging into data until the story becomes clear.\n\nClarity. Numbers only matter if people can understand them, so I put effort into making my work transparent — whether it’s through well-documented code, clear communication, or turning messy complexity into something others can actually use.\n\nCreativity. Even though I was trained in statistics, I enjoy approaching problems from unexpected angles. Data science, for me, is also a creative act: finding new ways to ask questions and design solutions. In many ways, I bring the same mindset I have as an artist into my work with data.\n\nGrowth. This field never stands still, and neither do I. I’m motivated by the chance to explore new ideas, test emerging tools, and push myself beyond what I already know. Learning isn’t a side activity, it’s at the heart of how I keep evolving.\n\nAdaptability. My background gave me the chance to move across research and applied projects, so I’m comfortable switching between rigor and creativity depending on the context.\n\nLooking ahead, I want to grow in an industry environment where these traits can translate into real impact. For me, the next step is about sharpening my skills in practice, learning from experienced teams, and contributing to work that matters beyond the notebook."
