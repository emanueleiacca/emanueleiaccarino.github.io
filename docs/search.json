    "text": "Hi there, I’m Emanuele Iaccarino.\nNumbers have always been my way of making sense of the world — turning ideas into structures, spotting patterns in the noise, and breaking problems into steps I could work through. For a long time I saw this as nothing more than my own way of thinking. Only later did I realize that this mindset is exactly what lies at the heart of data science, and that following this path wasn’t really a choice but the most natural direction forward.\nThat realization shaped my journey. What started as curiosity grew into building models, working with messy data, and uncovering the stories hidden inside. It became not just something I enjoyed, but something I wanted to dedicate myself to fully. Data science didn’t arrive in my life as a plan — it arrived as the recognition of what I had been doing all along.\nEven this website reflects that story. I built it with Quarto, the modern framework born from RStudio, where I first learned to bring statistics, code, and storytelling together. Using the same ecosystem here feels natural — a continuation of the roots that shaped me, now powering the place where I share what I’m building today."
