    "text": "Hi there, I’m Emanuele Iaccarino.\nNumbers have always been my way of making sense of the world — turning ideas into structures, spotting patterns in the noise, and breaking problems into steps I could work through. For a long time I saw this as nothing more than my own way of thinking. Only later did I realize that this mindset is exactly what lies at the heart of data science, and that following this path wasn’t really a choice but the most natural direction forward.\nThat realization shaped my journey. What started as curiosity grew into building models, working with messy data, and uncovering the stories hidden inside. It became not just something I enjoyed, but something I wanted to dedicate myself to fully. Data science didn’t arrive in my life as a plan — it arrived as the recognition of what I had been doing all along.\nEven this website reflects that story. I built it with Quarto, the modern framework born from RStudio, where I first learned to bring statistics, code, and storytelling together. Using the same ecosystem here feels natural — a continuation of the roots that shaped me, now powering the place where I share what I’m building today."

For me, clay was never just a material: it was something alive, something that teaches you to slow down, to experiment, and to accept that not everything comes out perfect on the first try.\nOver time I started creating my own pieces, and that experience shaped me just as much as any formal education. Ceramics taught me that beauty and meaning come from process as much as from outcome, and that even small imperfections can add character and authenticity.\nThat artistic background is still a big part of who I am. It keeps me connected to tradition, but also gives me perspective: the ability to see beyond function, to value form and story, and to treat what I build — in any context — as something that should carry both purpose and personality.\nAnd if you ever hire me as a data scientist, there’s a good chance you’ll also get a piece of my artwork on your desk — a small reminder that numbers and creativity aren’t so far apart after all.\n\n Take a look at my work here:\njg1w6f-ii.myshopify.com\n\n\n\n Recognition\nRegional Council of Campania — Award for Excellence in Production, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n Exhibitions of my artworks\nCeramic “Vesuvian cherry tomato horn” on Abramovich’s yacht\nA unique piece displayed on the yacht of Roman Abramovich, former Chelsea president.\n\n\nExhibitions across the Sorrento and Amalfi Peninsula\nCelebrating the traditions of my homeland through ceramic works.\n\n\n\n\n Media\nRegional cooking shows\nMy San Gennaro ceramic sculpture featured on local TV programs dedicated to Campania’s cuisine.\n\n\nFootball talk shows\nBringing the color and symbolism of Naples’ tradition into national football discussions."

    "text": "This study applies reinforcement learning (RL) to the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit, with case studies on WallJump and SoccerTwos.\nAlgorithms implemented include Imitation Learning, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), and POCA, evaluated with TensorBoard monitoring.\nEnhancements explored:\n- Curriculum learning in WallJump for complex task training\n- Self-play in SoccerTwos for competitive multi-agent strategies\n- Hyperparameter tuning for improved stability and performance\nKey results:\n- SAC outperformed PPO in continuous-control environments (3DBall)\n- Curriculum learning accelerated convergence in WallJump\n- Self-play produced stronger agents in adversarial settings\n- Hyperparameter tuning critically influenced model robustness\nRead on ResearchGate\n\n\n\nUnity ML-Agents environments explored: WallJump and SoccerTwos"
