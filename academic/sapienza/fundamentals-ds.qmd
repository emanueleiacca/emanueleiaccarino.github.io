## Overview
This course introduces the **foundational tools of data science**, combining machine learning, statistical modeling, and network science.  
Students learn how to treat data as a strategic asset, moving from data representation and preprocessing to model design, training, and evaluation.

## Main objectives
- Understand the core principles of **machine learning foundations** (regression, classification, neural networks, CNNs, transformers, multimodal ML)  
- Explore **complex networks and network science** (network properties, generative models, community detection)  
- Practice hands-on **Python programming** for data analysis and modeling  

---

## Learning outcomes
- Ability to design and evaluate discriminative and generative models  
- Translate complex phenomena into formal ML and network frameworks  
- Communicate results through **visualizations, metrics, and project presentations**  
- Develop autonomy to extend skills to computer vision, network science, and advanced ML
