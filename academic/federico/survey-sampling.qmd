## Overview
This course focused on the **theoretical foundations of survey sampling and social statistics**.  
Students learned the principles of designing and analyzing surveys, with attention to sampling techniques, treatment of missing data, and the evaluation of social and economic indicators.  
The perspective was strongly theoretical, but included practical projects to apply sampling methods to real-world social and economic issues.

## Main objectives
- Understand the **foundations of survey sampling** (simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling)  
- Learn methods for **handling missing data** and ensuring data quality  
- Apply survey methods to real-world social and economic datasets  
- Explore **composite indicators** (e.g. Human Development Index, Agenda 2030 goals)  
- Gain hands-on experience with **R** for survey data analysis  

---

## Learning outcomes
- Ability to design surveys and sampling plans for social research  
- Evaluate statistical methodologies for robustness and representativeness  
- Apply different imputation techniques for missing data (mean, median, regression, KNN, MICE, random forest, interpolation, etc.)  
- Critically interpret **Agenda 2030 indicators** in social and economic contexts  
- Communicate findings clearly through reports and presentations
