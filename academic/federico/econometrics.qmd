## Overview
The course introduces the **principles and standard techniques of time series analysis** applied to economics and finance.  
Students learn how to analyze, interpret, and forecast key economic and financial variables, using both **univariate and multivariate models**.  
A strong emphasis is placed on connecting statistical results with underlying economic theories.
