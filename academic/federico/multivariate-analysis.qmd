## Overview
This course provided a **first introduction to supervised and unsupervised learning** from a statistical perspective.  
The emphasis was on the **theoretical foundations**, with many demonstrations of key results in machine learning and classical multivariate methods.  

The course also introduced **R programming** as a practical tool for implementing models and running analyses, culminating in a final project.

## Main objectives
- Understand the basics of **supervised learning** (e.g., linear models, discriminant analysis, QDA, LDA)  
- Explore **unsupervised learning** (clustering, exploratory data analysis)  
- Develop skills in applying theoretical results to practical datasets  
- Learn to use **R and RStudio** for statistical modeling and data exploration  

---

## Learning outcomes
- Ability to implement and interpret **fundamental machine learning algorithms**  
- Strong theoretical background with proofs and demonstrations of ML concepts  
- First exposure to **statistical computing in R**  
- Capacity to critically evaluate methods through both theory and practice
