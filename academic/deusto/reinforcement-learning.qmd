## ðŸ“˜ Overview  

This course explored both **classical RL algorithms** (MDPs, Monte Carlo, SARSA, Q-Learning) and **modern deep RL techniques** (policy gradients, DQN, PPO, SAC).  
A strong emphasis was placed on **experimentation and projects**, from implementing tabular methods to building agents in complex environments.  
Trends such as **imitation learning, multi-agent systems, Curriculum learning and offline RL** were also introduced.
