## ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning  

This course provided a comprehensive introduction to modern ML workflows: from **data preparation and feature engineering** to the evaluation of supervised and unsupervised models.  
We covered classification (SVM, decision trees, random forests, naÃ¯ve Bayes), regression (linear, RANSAC, Theil-Sen, Huber, ensembles), clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixtures), and model interpretability techniques.  
The methodology strongly combined **theory and practice**, including hands-on projects and model optimization.
