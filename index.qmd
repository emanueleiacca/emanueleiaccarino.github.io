::: {#bio}
Hi there, I’m **<span class="text-terracotta">Emanuele Iaccarino</span>**.  
Numbers have always been my way of making sense of the world — turning **<span class="text-sage">ideas into structures</span>**, spotting **<span class="text-sage">patterns in the noise</span>**, and breaking problems into steps I could work through. For a long time I saw this as nothing more than my own way of thinking. Only later did I realize that this **<span class="text-violet">mindset</span>** is exactly what lies at the heart of **<span class="text-terracotta">data science</span>**, and that following this path wasn’t really a choice but the most natural direction forward.

That realization shaped my journey. What started as **<span class="text-terracotta">curiosity</span>** grew into building **<span class="text-sage">models</span>**, working with **<span class="highlight-block">messy data</span>**, and uncovering the **<span class="highlight-block">stories hidden inside</span>**. It became not just something I enjoyed, but something I wanted to dedicate myself to fully. **<span class="text-terracotta">Data science</span>** didn’t arrive in my life as a plan — it arrived as the recognition of what I had been doing all along.

Even this website reflects that story. I built it with **<span class="text-terracotta">Quarto</span>**, the modern framework born from RStudio, where I first learned to bring **<span class="text-violet">statistics, code, and storytelling</span>** together. Using the same ecosystem here feels natural — a continuation of the roots that shaped me, now powering the place where I share what I’m building today.
