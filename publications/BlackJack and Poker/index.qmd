This thesis explores **reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)** techniques in **Blackjack and Poker**, two games of incomplete information that require complex strategy under uncertainty.  

Methods include **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, **Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR)**, **Deep Monte Carlo (DMC)**, and **Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP)**, evaluated for their ability to handle stochasticity, hidden information, and strategic adaptation.  

**Key results**:  
- **DQN** learns structured Blackjack strategies effectively  
- **CFR** and **NFSP** excel in Poker, adapting to incomplete information  
- **DMC** achieves robust convergence in high-dimensional state spaces  
- DRL methods demonstrate potential for **superhuman performance** in competitive card games
