This project develops a **deep learning pipeline** for mammogram classification using the **CBIS-DDSM dataset**, addressing preprocessing, augmentation, and model training challenges in medical imaging.  

Techniques include **ROI extraction**, intensity maps, gradient transformations, and **custom data augmentation** (ROI overlay, geometric transformations, blended cropping). Pretrained CNNs were fine-tuned through **transfer learning**, achieving state-of-the-art performance among public baselines.  

**Key results**:  
- Preprocessing improved convergence and accuracy  
- Transfer learning boosted generalization performance  
- Augmentation strategies reduced overfitting  
- Demonstrated potential for **scalable and reproducible breast cancer diagnostics**
