This study applies **reinforcement learning (RL)** to the **Unity ML-Agents Toolkit**, with case studies on *WallJump* and *SoccerTwos*.  
Algorithms implemented include **Imitation Learning, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), and POCA**, evaluated with TensorBoard monitoring.  

Enhancements explored:  
- **Curriculum learning** in WallJump for complex task training  
- **Self-play** in SoccerTwos for competitive multi-agent strategies  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** for improved stability and performance  

**Key results**:  
- **SAC** outperformed PPO in continuous-control environments (*3DBall*)  
- Curriculum learning accelerated convergence in WallJump  
- Self-play produced stronger agents in adversarial settings  
- Hyperparameter tuning critically influenced model robustness
