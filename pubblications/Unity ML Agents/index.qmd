This work explores the application of **reinforcement learning (RL)** within Unity ML Agents environments, providing both practical tutorials and comparative analysis.  

Central to the study is the implementation of algorithms including **Imitation Learning, PPO, SAC, and POCA**, applied to Unity environments such as *3DBall*, *WallJump*, and *SoccerTwos*.  

Key contributions:  

- Introduces Unity ML Toolkit for reinforcement learning research  
- Implements multiple RL algorithms with TensorBoard monitoring  
- Applies **curriculum learning** in WallJump to accelerate training  
- Uses **self-play** in SoccerTwos for competitive agent learning  
- Demonstrates the role of hyperparameter tuning in agent stability and performance  

**Findings**  
- SAC outperformed PPO in continuous-control tasks (*3DBall*)  
- Curriculum learning enabled efficient convergence in complex environments  
- Self-play produced more robust agents in adversarial settings  
- Hyperparameter adjustments had significant effects on model performance
