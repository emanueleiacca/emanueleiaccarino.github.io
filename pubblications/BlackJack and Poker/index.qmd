### ðŸ“„ Abstract  

The domain of **card games**, marked by complexity, uncertainty, and strategic depth, provides a fertile ground for advancing **reinforcement learning (RL)**. This thesis explores the use of both RL and **deep reinforcement learning (DRL)** algorithms in **Blackjack** and **Poker**, two games of incomplete information.  

Algorithms studied:  
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**  
- **Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR)**  
- **Deep Monte Carlo (DMC)**  
- **Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP)**

### ðŸ”‘ Key Contributions  

- Systematic evaluation of RL and DRL algorithms in incomplete-information games  
- Demonstrated **superhuman performance** in specific game configurations  
- Provided insights into how algorithms develop **strategic learning and decision-making processes**  
- Highlighted differences in algorithm adaptability to **stochasticity and hidden information**

### ðŸ“Œ Findings  

- **DQN** proved effective in learning structured Blackjack strategies  
- **CFR** and **NFSP** excelled in handling incomplete information in Poker  
- **DMC** offered robust convergence in complex state spaces  
- Results demonstrate that DRL can replicate and surpass human strategies in competitive card games
