### ðŸ“„ Abstract  

**Mammography** is a cornerstone in the early detection of breast cancer, where accurate image classification is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment. While deep learning has shown great promise in medical imaging, the **CBIS-DDSM dataset**â€”one of the largest repositories of breast cancer mammogramsâ€”remains relatively underexplored, with limited reproducible research available.  

This project implements a **deep learning pipeline** for mammography classification, addressing preprocessing, augmentation, and training challenges in medical imaging.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Contributions  

- Preprocessing strategies: ROI extraction, intensity maps, and gradient magnitude transformations  
- Custom data augmentation: geometric transformations, ROI overlay, and blended cropping  
- Model development: pretrained CNNs with **transfer learning**, fine-tuned for CBIS mammograms  
- Reproducibility: publicly available code and methodology for reproducible medical ML research

### ðŸ“Œ Findings  

- Preprocessing significantly improved model convergence and accuracy  
- Transfer learning with fine-tuning achieved **state-of-the-art performance** among public baselines  
- Augmentation strategies reduced overfitting and improved generalization  
- Results demonstrate the potential of deep learning for **scalable, reproducible breast cancer diagnostics**
