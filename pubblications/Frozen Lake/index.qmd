### ðŸ“„ Abstract  

This study delves into the nuances of various **reinforcement learning algorithms** in the context of the **Frozen Lake environment**, offering a comprehensive analysis of their behaviors under both deterministic and stochastic settings.  

Algorithms evaluated include:  
- Monte Carlo  
- Sarsa  
- Expected Sarsa  
- Q-Learning  
- Double Q-Learning  

A significant portion of the research focuses on **hyperparameter optimization** using the Optuna framework, specifically targeting Q-Learning.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Contributions  

- Comparative evaluation of five RL algorithms in deterministic vs stochastic Frozen Lake  
- Analysis of learning dynamics and convergence behaviors  
- Hyperparameter tuning via **Optuna** for Q-Learning (discount rate, learning rate, exploration strategies)  
- Insights into how hyperparameter interactions impact efficiency and stability

### ðŸ“Œ Findings  

- Q-Learning and Double Q-Learning showed robustness in stochastic environments  
- Discount rate and learning rate proved critical for convergence speed and stability  
- Optuna-based optimization improved Q-Learning efficiency in both environments  
- The study provides practical guidance for RL applications in grid-world tasks
