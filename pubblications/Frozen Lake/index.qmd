This project evaluates **reinforcement learning algorithms** in the **Frozen Lake environment**, under both deterministic and stochastic settings.  
Algorithms studied include **Monte Carlo, Sarsa, Expected Sarsa, Q-Learning, and Double Q-Learning**.  

A key focus is **hyperparameter optimization** with **Optuna**, applied to Q-Learning to improve learning efficiency.  

**Key results**:  
- Q-Learning and Double Q-Learning performed robustly in stochastic scenarios  
- Discount rate and learning rate were critical for convergence and stability  
- Optuna tuning enhanced Q-Learningâ€™s efficiency across environments  
- Findings provide guidance for RL applications in grid-world tasks
